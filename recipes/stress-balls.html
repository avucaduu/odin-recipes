            <ul>
                <li>Ground mix of expectations, mid-life crisis, peer pressure, and financial instability.</li>
                <li>Salt and Pepper</li> 
                <li>Powdered form of garlic and onion because the fresh ones just ain't cutting it.</li>

                <li>All-purpose flour</li>

            <br>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 180 degree Celsius.</li>
                <li>Mix all the listed ingredients. If you're looking for the measurements, we ain't have that here. ASK YOUR ANCESTORS!</li>
                <li>Portion out the mixture into giant balls of your liking. Line it up in a baking pan.</li>
                <li>Stick that in the oven and broil for 2 minutes. Turn the meatballs then broil for another 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add sauce of choice. I like spaghetti sauce. Melt some cheese on top then serve.</li>
                <li>Fill yourself up with this delicious balls just like everyone else in this miserable world.</li>
