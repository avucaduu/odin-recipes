                <li>Tiny amount of lemon zest and juice for a little zing</li>
                <li>3-5 drops of sweat obtained through being spooked</li>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 230 degrees Celsius. Line a pie plate with the first pie crust pack.</li>
                <li>Combine the zing, sweat, sugar, cinnonym, and flour in a bowl.</li>
                <li>Read out your fear list and tear through each fear one by one.</li>
                <li>Arrange layers of the torn off fear pieces in the crust made in step 1. Add some of the mixture made in step 2 over each layer. Put some small pieces of butter for some added flavor and richness.</li>
                <li>Cover the pie with the remaining pack of pie crust and seal the edges. Be thorough with this process as we don't want the fear filling to come out.</li>
                <li>Bake in preheated oven for around 10 min. After 10 min, lower the temperature to 175 degrees Celsius. Bake for another 35 to 40 minutes until crust is golden.</li>
            </ol>
